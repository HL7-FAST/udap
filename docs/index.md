# FAST Security Reference Implementation

This is the documentation for the FAST Security Reference Implementation (RI).  It provides an open-source implementation of the [FAST Security Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig).

The server is a .NET application that builds on top of the following:
- [Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver)
- [UDAP.NET](https://github.com/udap-tools/udap-dotnet)

The source code for this server is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HL7-FAST/udap)

A public hosted instance of the server is available in the HL7 Foundry at <https://udap-security.fast.hl7.org>

For instructions on running the server, see the [Getting Started](setup/getting-started.md) guide.
